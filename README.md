# 01-HTML-CSS-Git

Website was almost completely overhauled, with all div tags removed. 
Scematic html was googled, and placed into website
accesability tags were added to code and alt tags to images
class and id tags that flooded the .html were also removed.
this proved to be a mistake since i needed to reference the original files for help.
the <div> tags confused me so I attempted to edit line by line
  this did not help since div tags had their own css code
  many tears, headaches, and ctrl + z later, I am left with an undone website.
